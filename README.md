CERN@school-Cluster-Analysis
================================
All of the codes necessary to analyse the data and reproduce the results presented in the Beta Transmission in Aluminium experiment.

1. Copy and paste the code to your computer

2. Open the script in IDLE

3. Download the necessary data files from figshare.com

4. Follow the instructions given in the code description
included i.e changing the datapath

5. Press F5 to run the code

Every script except the Simple-Cluster-Analyser is set up 
such that it will run out of the box, as the data was 
manually input from the experiment. The Simple-Cluster-
Analyser does the initial analysis that allowed for these 
completions.

To download the data for the Strontium-90 sample, download 
and unzip the file from 
http://figshare.com/articles/Strontium_Decay_Data/769308

To download the data for the Potassium-40 sample, download 
and unzip the file from 
http://figshare.com/articles/Potassium_Decay_Data/769309

The Timepix detector settings are included in the .dsc 
files in the data sets. If you wish to reproduce the 
experiment yourself, the set-up details are included in 
the descriptions alonside the data sets on figshare.com
